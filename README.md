# TD-Ameritrade
Image Gallery Application for TD Ameritrade


This application uses the latest version of Angular (4.x) and Typescript. I was asked to build this application as a verification of Angular skills for a potential new employer. Take everything with that grain of salt.

To run, have current versions of node.js and git installed on your machine. Clone this repository. Execute `npm install` to generate a node-modules folder for dependencies. Run `ng serve` to run the application in localhost. Go to `localhost:4200` in any browser.
